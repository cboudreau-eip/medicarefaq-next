    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medigap Plan G",
    text: "I was completely overwhelmed when I turned 65 and had to figure out Medicare. The team at MedicareFAQ walked me through every option and helped me find a Plan G that saved me over $800 a year compared to what I was originally quoted. I couldn't be happier with the service.",
  },
  {
    name: "Robert K.",
    location: "Texas",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medicare Advantage",
    text: "After my wife passed, I needed to get my own Medicare coverage for the first time. I was nervous about making the wrong choice. The specialist I spoke with was patient, knowledgeable, and never pushy. He explained all my options clearly and I ended up with a Medicare Advantage plan that includes dental — something I really needed.",
  },
  {
    name: "Dorothy M.",
    location: "Ohio",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medigap Plan N",
    text: "I've been a client for three years now and have referred several friends. Every year during open enrollment, they review my plan and make sure I'm still getting the best value. That kind of ongoing service is rare.",
  },
  {
    name: "James W.",
    location: "Arizona",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Part D Drug Plan",
    text: "My prescription costs were getting out of hand. The MedicareFAQ team helped me find a Part D plan that covered all my medications at a much lower tier. I'm saving about $150 a month on drugs alone. I wish I had called them sooner.",
  },
  {
    name: "Patricia L.",
    location: "North Carolina",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medigap Plan G",
    text: "The website has so much helpful information — I spent hours reading the guides before calling. When I did call, the agent already seemed to know exactly what I needed. The process was smooth and I felt confident in my decision.",
  },
  {
    name: "Harold B.",
    location: "Pennsylvania",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medicare Advantage HMO",
    text: "I was skeptical about using an online resource for something as important as Medicare. But the information on MedicareFAQ is accurate and up to date — I checked it against Medicare.gov. The agent I worked with was licensed and professional. I'm very satisfied.",
  },
  {
    name: "Susan R.",
    location: "Georgia",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medigap Plan G",
    text: "My husband had a serious health event last year and we were so grateful we had Plan G. We didn't pay a single bill beyond the Part B deductible. MedicareFAQ helped us choose that plan two years ago and it was absolutely the right decision.",
  },
  {
    name: "William C.",
    location: "Michigan",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medigap Plan F (grandfathered)",
    text: "I've been on Medicare for 10 years. I recently used MedicareFAQ to review whether I should stay on Plan F or switch. They gave me an honest assessment — in my case, staying on Plan F made sense. I appreciated that they didn't try to sell me something I didn't need.",
  },
  {
    name: "Linda H.",
    location: "California",
    rating: 5,
    plan: "Medicare Advantage PPO",
    text: "Living in California, I have a lot of Medicare Advantage options. The comparison tools on MedicareFAQ helped me narrow down the choices and the specialist helped me understand the network differences. I ended up with a PPO that lets me keep my doctor.",
