  },
  {
    q: "What if I miss my Medigap Open Enrollment Period?",
    a: "You can still apply for Medigap after your OEP ends, but insurers can use medical underwriting. They may deny your application, charge higher premiums, or exclude pre-existing conditions for up to 6 months. Some people with serious health conditions may be unable to get Medigap coverage after their OEP.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I switch Medigap plans after I enroll?",
    a: "Yes, but you'll generally need to pass medical underwriting unless you have a guaranteed issue right. The best time to switch is during your OEP or when you have a guaranteed issue right. In some states, you can switch during your Medigap birthday rule (if your state has one).",
  },
  {
    q: "Does my Medigap plan cover my spouse?",
    a: "No. Medigap plans are individual policies — each person needs their own plan. If both you and your spouse want Medigap coverage, you each need to apply separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Medigap birthday rule?",
    a: "Several states (including California, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Oregon) have a 'birthday rule' that gives you a window each year around your birthday to switch to a Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits without medical underwriting. Check your state's rules for specifics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I be denied Medigap coverage?",
    a: "Outside of your Open Enrollment Period and guaranteed issue situations, yes — insurers can deny your Medigap application based on your health history. This is why enrolling during your OEP is so important. During your OEP, denial is not allowed.",
