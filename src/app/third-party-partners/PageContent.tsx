              MedicareFAQ is a licensed insurance agency. When you enroll in a Medicare plan through our agency, we receive a commission from the insurance carrier. This commission is built into the plan's pricing — it does not cost you anything extra compared to enrolling directly with the carrier.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our compensation structure is designed to align our interests with yours. We are paid a similar commission regardless of which plan you choose, which means we have no financial incentive to recommend one plan over another. Our goal is to help you find the plan that is genuinely best for your situation.
