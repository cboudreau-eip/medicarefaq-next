    a: "The standard Medicare Part B premium in 2026 is $202.90 per month. Higher-income beneficiaries pay more through IRMAA surcharges, which are based on income reported two years prior (2024 income for 2026 premiums).",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Part B deductible in 2026?",
    a: "The Medicare Part B deductible in 2026 is $283. After you meet the deductible, Medicare typically pays 80% of approved costs and you pay the remaining 20% coinsurance — with no out-of-pocket cap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I delay Part B enrollment if I have employer coverage?",
    a: "Yes. If you or your spouse is actively working and covered by an employer group health plan based on that current employment, you can delay Part B without penalty. You'll have a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to sign up when that coverage ends.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I miss my Part B enrollment window?",
    a: "If you don't enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period and don't qualify for a Special Enrollment Period, you'll face a late enrollment penalty. Your Part B premium increases 10% for each full 12-month period you were eligible but didn't enroll — and this penalty is permanent.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Part B cover preventive care at no cost?",
    a: "Yes. Medicare Part B covers many preventive services at no cost to you — including the annual wellness visit, flu shots, mammograms, colonoscopies, and various cancer screenings — when you see a Medicare-participating provider.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Part B 20% coinsurance?",
    a: "After you meet the $283 deductible, Medicare Part B pays 80% of approved charges for covered services. You're responsible for the remaining 20%. There is no out-of-pocket maximum, so a serious illness can result in significant costs. A Medigap plan can cover this 20% coinsurance.",

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Medicare Part B is the medical insurance component of Original Medicare. While Part A covers inpatient hospital care, Part B covers outpatient services — everything from routine doctor visits and lab tests to preventive screenings and durable medical equipment. Part B is optional, but most people enroll because the late enrollment penalty is permanent and the coverage is essential.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Unlike Part A, Part B always has a monthly premium. The standard premium in 2026 is $202.90/month, though higher-income beneficiaries pay more through IRMAA (Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount) surcharges.

                    <p className="text-sm text-red-800 mb-3">
                      For every 12-month period you were eligible for Part B but didn't enroll (without creditable coverage), your premium increases by 10%. This penalty is added to your monthly premium for as long as you have Part B.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-sm text-red-800">
                      <strong>Example:</strong> If you delayed Part B for 2 years without creditable coverage, your premium would be $202.90 × 1.20 = $243.48/month in 2026 — and this higher rate stays with you permanently.
                    </p>

              </div>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                The penalty does not apply if you had creditable coverage (like employer group health insurance based on active employment) during the delay period.
