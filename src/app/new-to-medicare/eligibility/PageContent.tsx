                Medicare eligibility is primarily based on <strong>age</strong>, <strong>disability status</strong>, or <strong>specific medical conditions</strong>. Most Americans become eligible at age 65, but there are several pathways to qualify earlier. Understanding which category applies to you is the first step toward getting the coverage you need.
