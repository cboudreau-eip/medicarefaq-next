            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You may wonder how we can provide expert Medicare guidance at no cost to you. The answer is straightforward: insurance carriers pay us a commission when you enroll in a plan through our agency. This is the same commission you would pay if you enrolled directly with the carrier — it does not cost you anything extra.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Importantly, our compensation does not influence our recommendations. We are contractually obligated to recommend the plan that is best for you, and our reputation depends on it. We only succeed when our clients are genuinely satisfied with their coverage.
